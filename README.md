## Introduction

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. It is particularly useful when integrating new features into existing systems or when reusing code with incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called the adapter that connects functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

## Files

This repository contains implementations of the Adapter Design Pattern in the following languages:

- **C#**
  - `ChargerAdapter.cs`: Contains the C# implementation of the adapter class and related interfaces.
  - `Charging.cs`: Implements the charging functionality using the adapter.
  - `Program.cs`: Main entry point to demonstrate the usage of the adapter.

- **Java**
  - `ChargerAdapter.java`: Java implementation of the adapter class and related interfaces.
  - `Charging.java`: Implements the charging functionality using the adapter.
  - `iPhone.java`: Represents an iPhone class for demonstration purposes.
  - `Phone.java`: Main entry point to demonstrate the usage of the adapter in Java.

- **Kotlin**
  - `ChargerAdapter.kt`: Kotlin implementation of the adapter class and related interfaces.
  - `Charging.kt`: Implements the charging functionality using the adapter.
  - `IPhone.kt`: Represents an iPhone class for demonstration purposes.
  - `Main.kt`: Main entry point to demonstrate the usage of the adapter in Kotlin.

## Usage

To use the Adapter Design Pattern in your project:

1. Choose the appropriate implementation for your programming language from the files provided.
2. Integrate the adapter class (`ChargerAdapter` or equivalent) into your project.
3. Utilize the adapter to connect and enable communication between incompatible interfaces.

Refer to the specific language implementation files for detailed usage instructions.
