The Adapter design pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together seamlessly. 
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of one class into another interface that a client expects.
This pattern is particularly useful when integrating new components into an existing system without modifying its existing codebase. 
By using adapters, classes with incompatible interfaces can collaborate without needing to modify their source code, promoting code reusability and flexibility. 
Overall, the Adapter pattern promotes interoperability and helps in achieving better maintainability and scalability in software systems.
